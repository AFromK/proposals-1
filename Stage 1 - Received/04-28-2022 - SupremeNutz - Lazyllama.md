## Proposal Summary
*Sweeping Lazy Llamas OG/ Mutants/ Serums (T2, T1, Mystery).*

We like to propose Boss DAO utilizes **30,000 ADA** of treasury funds to sweep the Lazy Llamas OG/ Mutants / Serums (T2, T1, Mystery) in view of the upcoming airdrop of Vox Llamas **(Snapshot 7th May, 2022)**

We'd want lazy llamas, Mutant llamas, Vox llamas and lazy tokens to be the primary factor in increasing boss daos treasury value through free assets and boosted passive income via $Lazy token. With the Govenance system in place, we will be able to stake them in the near future.

We recognize that treasury funds may be limited with its utlisation. As such we add the provision that if the Founders find 30000 ADA too much for the existing treasury that all of the above will still be implemented, It will be reduced in all proportions by 25-50%. Reducing the total funding to 5000 ADA for each OG llamas, Serums and Mutants. Chosen specifics within each category will also be decided at the founders' discretion.


## Proposal Details

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000 ada** to sweep OG llamas for upcoming mutation of T2 and future mutation of T1 and Mystery serums. Mutants llamas will earn more passive income via $lazy token airdrop on the 15th of every month.

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000 ada** to sweep Mutants llamas as they are undervalued now. At the time of T3 mutation, floor of OG llama was at 500 ada, T3 serum floor at 400 ada, mint requires 40 ada, total value at 940 ada. Current floor price of mutant llama is only at 430 ada, grossly undervalued.

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000 ada** to sweep Serums (T2, T1 and Mystery). Currently Boss DAO only owns T3 serums, for future mutation other Tiers serums are required and since T2, T1 and Mystery serums are higher Tier serums, they would collect more airdrop of $lazy token.

In addition to the above sweeping, Lazy Llamas will be airdropping **Vox Llamas** base on the assets holding. Snap shot will be taken on 7th May. Below are the breakdown of the requirement:

2 x OG Llamas  = **1 Vox

1 x 1-of-1 Llama = **3 Vox

1 x Biomutant = **1 Vox

6 x Tier-3 Serums = **1 Vox 

4 x Tier-2 Serums = **1 Vox 

1 x Tier-1 Serum = **1 Vox 

1 x Clone Serum = **2 Vox 

1 x Mystery Serum = **2 Vox 

The total supply of Vox llama is estimated to be around **5600** depending on the final snapshot on **7th May**. Currently lazy llamas holders are in the process of mutating their OG llamas with serums to qualiy for more Vox Llamas.

On the **15th of every month**, airdrop of $lazy token will happen. All OG llamas will receive 5000 $lazy airdrop and Mutants 12500 $lazy. Currently $lazy token is available for trade at MuesliSwap. Current trade value at 0.0025 ada per $lazy. Prices fluctuate depending on bid/offer. 

Potentially each OG llama receives 12.5 ada (5000 $lazy x 0.0025). Mutant receives 31.25 ada.

Currently Boss DAO treasury has **265253 $lazy token** which translates to **663 ada** with just 1 month of holding the asset.

I believe Vox Llamas would be entitled to $lazy token airdrop. Details have not been announced.

Once Utility of $Lazy Token has been fully implemented, which will be detailed in upcoming Lazy Paper 3.0, the value can only increase further. Holders of Boss DAO cannot be happier will such passive income from holding Lazy llamas assets.

With the date of Vox llama snapshot coming close, I sincerely hope Boss DAO can quickly vet through this proposal and approve for members voting by **3rd May** to allow time for sweeping.
